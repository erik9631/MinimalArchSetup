# Asus zenbook
    - Was giving me dbus errors for pipewire in the systemctl logs. Installing sof-firmware fixed it
    - pipewire uses rtkit to get realtime scheduling, but it's not installed by default. Installing it fixed errors
    - In case of audio fade bug
        /etc/modprobe.d/disablePower.conf
      options snd_hda_intel power_save=0
    and reboot.
    if you have a power saving daemon like TLP or laptop-mode-tools they will have their own config for this, disable that there in case
